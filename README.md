# GLW
GLW - A C++ GLFW wrapper, which requires C++17.

# Specifics
Everything needed is inside the GLW namespace, which has more namespaces inside it for more specific functions. Include GLW.h and everything is added!

# Vulkan Support
I have never used Vulkan personally, so I do not know if the current wrapper is good enough. If anyone ever sees this and wants to change that, feel free to make a request!
